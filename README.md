# day-28_pomodoro
Day 28 of 100.

This is a visual representation of the Pomodoro method, which is a time management technique with the goal to maximize efficiency in workflow with minimal drainage of one's motivation.

How it works: The user works diligently for 25min straight followed by a 5-minute break. After each rep of 25min work blocks, user earns a checkmark. After 4 checkmarks, the user earns a longer break. The standard model would be a 20min break if the user had 5 min breaks in between each work rep.

However, I modified it a bit to allow the user to input how long they think each work block should be as well as the breaks. If the user would rather work for 40min blocks with 10-minute breaks, they can, or whatever they prefer.
